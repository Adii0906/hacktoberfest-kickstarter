# 📄 Resume Upload & AI Auto-Fill Feature

## Overview

This feature allows users to automatically create their profile by uploading their resume and having AI extract and fill their profile preferences based on the resume content.

## Features

### ✨ What's New

1. **Resume Upload**: Support for PDF and DOCX file formats
2. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Intelligent extraction of skills, experience level, and interests
3. **Auto-Fill Profile**: Automatically pre-selects relevant checkboxes in the profile form
4. **Manual Override**: Users can modify any AI-extracted selections
5. **Resume Preview**: Shows extracted text preview for verification

### 🔧 Implementation Details

#### Files Modified/Added:

1. **`services/resume_service.py`** - Production-ready service using Gemini 2.5 lite API
2. **`services/mock_resume_service.py`** - Demo version that simulates AI analysis
3. **`pages/01_🏠_Profile_Setup.py`** - Updated with resume upload UI
4. **`requirements.txt`** - Added necessary dependencies

#### Dependencies Added:
- `google-generativeai` - For Gemini API integration
- `PyPDF2==3.0.1` - PDF text extraction
- `python-docx==1.1.0` - DOCX text extraction  
- `pdfplumber==0.10.2` - Enhanced PDF text extraction

### 🚀 How It Works

1. **Upload Resume**: User uploads PDF or DOCX file
2. **Text Extraction**: System extracts text content from the file
3. **AI Analysis**: Gemini 2.5 lite analyzes the text to identify:
   - Experience level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
   - Programming skills from predefined list
   - Areas of interest based on project descriptions
4. **Auto-Fill**: Profile form is pre-populated with AI-extracted data
5. **Review & Edit**: User can modify selections before saving

### 🎯 AI Analysis Process

The AI analyzes resumes using a structured prompt to extract:

#### Experience Level Detection:
- **Beginner**: Keywords like "junior", "entry", "intern", "1-2 years"
- **Intermediate**: Keywords like "3-5 years", "mid-level" 
- **Advanced**: Keywords like "senior", "lead", "6+ years", "architect"

#### Skills Extraction:
Matches resume content against predefined skill list:
```
JavaScript, Python, Java, TypeScript, React, Vue.js, Angular,
Node.js, Express, Django, Flask, Docker, AWS, etc.
```

#### Interest Inference:
Maps project descriptions to interest categories:
```
frontend, backend, fullstack, mobile, web, api, database,
devops, cloud, ai, machine-learning, security, testing, etc.
```

### 🔒 Security & Privacy

- Resume text is processed in-memory only
- No permanent storage of resume content
- Only extracted metadata (skills/interests) is retained
- Files are processed client-side when possible

### 🌟 User Experience

#### Before:
- Manual selection of 40+ skills checkboxes
- Manual selection of 25+ interest areas
- Risk of missing relevant options

#### After:
- One-click upload and processing
- Intelligent pre-selection based on actual experience
- Review and refine suggested selections
- Dramatically faster profile creation

### 🔧 Configuration

#### Production Setup (Gemini API):
```python
from services.resume_service import ResumeService
resume_service = ResumeService(api_key="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY")
```

#### Demo Mode:
```python
from services.mock_resume_service import MockResumeService
resume_service = MockResumeService()
```

### 📱 UI Components

#### Upload Section:
- File uploader (PDF/DOCX support)
- Processing button with loading indicator
- Progress feedback and error handling

#### Results Display:
- Extracted information preview
- Skills and interests count
- Resume text preview (collapsible)

#### Form Integration:
- Pre-checked skills based on AI analysis
- Pre-selected interests from extracted data
- Pre-set experience level radio button
- All selections remain editable

### 🎨 Visual Design

- Clean, intuitive upload interface
- Color-coded sections (blue for upload, green for success)
- Progressive disclosure (expandable sections)
- Consistent with existing app styling
- Mobile-responsive layout

### 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_mock_resume_service.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ MockResumeService initialized successfully

📊 Experience Level: advanced
💻 Skills Found: [15 skills]
🎯 Interests: [12 interests]
```

### 🚀 Future Enhancements

1. **Support Additional Formats**: DOC, TXT files
2. **Enhanced AI Models**: Upgrade to newer Gemini versions

## 📋 API Key Setup (Production)

To use the real Gemini API instead of the mock service:

1. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Replace the mock service import in `pages/01_🏠_Profile_Setup.py`:
   ```python
   # Change this:
   from services.mock_resume_service import MockResumeService
   resume_service = MockResumeService()
   
   # To this:
   from services.resume_service import ResumeService  
   resume_service = ResumeService(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
   ```

The provided API key `AIzaSyCZ7sFBZKmuj4Tk4Md7NF-G5W4pI0Hxz7A` is already configured in the production service.
